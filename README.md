## OTP_generator_JSProject
The Custom OTP Generator is a web application built using JavaScript that allows users to generate one-time passwords with a custom length. OTPs are widely used for secure authentication purposes, especially in scenarios where traditional passwords are not deemed secure enough.

#Key Features:

Customizable Length: Users can choose the length of the OTP they want to generate, providing flexibility based on their specific security requirements.

Random Generation: The application utilizes JavaScript's random number generation capabilities to ensure that each OTP generated is unique and unpredictable.

User Interface: The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to easily input their desired OTP length and generate the corresponding OTP.

Copy to Clipboard: Upon OTP generation, users have the option to copy the generated OTP to their clipboard with a single click, enhancing usability and convenience.

#Technologies Used:

**HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring the web page and styling the user interface.
**JavaScript:** The primary programming language for implementing the OTP generation logic and handling user interactions.
**Clipboard API:** Utilized to enable the "copy to clipboard" functionality.
